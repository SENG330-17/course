## Mechanics
The class will use [Github](https://github.com/SENG330) and [Microsoft Teams](https://onlineservices.uvic.ca). Students will have to register their Github username (either a permanent one or a throwaway) with the instructors. Those with an objection to using Github please contact the instructor for workarounds. All Github activity is private to the class organization. Please see the privacy notice on the Brightspace site.

[Teams]() will be the primary mechanism used for communication in the class. My rationale (apart from being tools used in practice) is to expose the class as a whole to questions about assignment and lectures. 

Grades and Videos are distributed via Brightspace for privacy compliance.

University and department policies on professional conduct and integrity are applicable. Feel free to see me in person, or via UVic email, for personal questions.
