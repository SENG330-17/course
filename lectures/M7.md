## M7

### Learning Objectives

- Inheritance and where to use it
- Types and subtypes
- Cautions about inheritance 
- Template method design pattern as inheritance example

### Videos

- 7-1 What gets inherited - abstract, fields, overrides and duplicated code
  - Player and sport specific players
  - Casting Players - downcasting
  - Code reuse
  - Composition vs inheritance. Favour composition for run time flexibility, but inheritance for compile time configuration.
- 7-2 Implementing a template method
- 7-3 Code smells and Refactoring - why/how/types
  - Heuristics in software development
  - Books to read: samples
    - [Refactoring, Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)
    - [Pragmatic  Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer)
    - [Code Complete, Steve McConnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete)
    - [Implementation Patterns, Kent Beck](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/implementation-patterns/9780321413093/)
  - Code smells discussed - here is [a good reference](https://refactoring.guru/introduce-parameter-object) (other than the book) for both smells and refactorings
    - Long method
    - Shotgun surgery
    - Feature Envy
    - Long Param List
  - Refactoring 
    - Rename
    - Extract method
    - Parameter object

### Discussion/chat topics

#### Day 1

- Group discussion

#### Day 2

- Misuses of inheritance  https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/composition-vs-inheritance-how-chooseob

  - Semantic relations (Stack vs ArrayList) 
  - Violate encapsulation

  * Cross-domain relationships 
  * Fragile base class 
  * No need to make every real world "thing" an Object. 

- Code review exercise. I will present a sample piece of code, as a Github PR, and everyone will get to create comments on it.

  - How many have received a code review in practice?
  - How many have performed a code review?
  - What is one thing to check for in code review?

  * Steps:
    * Assign reviewers
    * Iterate and improve (use checklists)
    * Use tools to automate checks like Pep8
    * Reflect on code review process

  - Greiler's code review checklist: https://github.com/margaretstorey/EmseUvic2020/blob/master/activities/CodeReviewChecklistMGreiler.pdf

- Please read [Case Against OOP is Overstated](https://medium.com/young-coder/the-case-against-oop-is-wildly-overstated-572eae5ab495) and [Code Review at MSFT](https://www.michaelagreiler.com/code-reviews-at-microsoft-how-to-code-review-at-a-large-software-company/)

#### Day 3

* Office hours
