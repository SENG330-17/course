# Inversion of Control
- demo of Lucky Number
    + design problems without observer
    + separate :
        + program elements responsible for storing state, (a database, for example, and associated objects)
        + program elements responsible for viewing state, (a View, e.g. a web page or this UI)
        + program elements responsible for changing state (the commands sent by the user)
    - Observer pattern:
        + model uninterested in observers (what they do)
        + register / deregister as needed
        + IOC and callback approach

# inversion of control and dependency injection (D in SOLID)
- something else controls the program flow (often a framework)
- graphic from notes
- [Observer/Observable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/Observable.html) interface in JDK
- Dependency Injection example  ([Guice](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation))
    -separate behaviour from dependency resolution
    + takes a set of components (classes + interfaces) 
    + Adds a set of configuration metadata
    + Provides the metadata to an injection framework
    + Bootstraps object creation with a configured injector (courtesy Reid Holmes)
    + See [CreditCard example](https://github.com/caplin/Guice-Example.git). Note: the Yahoo API does not work anymore.
- We could write unit tests as normal. Not always possible: charging CCs.
- We could use a Factory to offload dependency management.
- But then we are exposing dependencies directly, and Factories grow in number
- DI stage 1: introduce the dependencies as constructor params
    + but now clients are responsible for managing dependencies
- DI with Guice: use the framework to bind dependencies in a separate module.
- Note: the essential complexity of managing dependencies does not go away. But, we can reduce the accidental complexity by modularizing it into a single place.

# Visitor Pattern

**Context/Problem**: Make it possible to support an open-ended number of operations that can be applied to an object graph, but without impacting the interface of the objects in the graph.

**Participants/Structure**: fig 8.23, 

![visitor at wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Visitor_design_pattern.svg/430px-Visitor_design_pattern.svg.png)

The visitor is really about inverting control and ensuring *loose coupling*, because we delegate operations to an entirely separate group of objects - the visitor objects - via the Accept method. Once we accept the visitor, it permits visitor code to define its own operations, entirely without the knowledge of the concrete elements. 

A simple visitor is a tree traversal (in,post,pre) which prints the name of each node it visits. 

Consider an epidemiological tree that stores transmission info. You are a child of a node if you were infected by the parent node. We want to print out the names of all the infected people in our study area. 

What is different about the code (`SoftwareDesign.m8`) implementing this approach? ( the data structure and the traversal are tightly coupled). Visitor allows us to transfer the control over what we do with the data structure to entirely different set of objects.

The book provides some good motivation. In the Solitaire example, we might want to add new functionality to `CardSource` for 1) printing/logging cards, 2) looking for cards, 3) removing a card. We could add all that to the interface directly, but the ISP suggests we only want to depend on interfaces we (the client) will need. And it is hard to guess what will be needed in the future (YAGNI). 

## Object traversal

Our next question is how to implement the traversal of all the objects in the graph (e.g, all Cards in the Deck). We have two choices: either in the Visitor, or in the Object itself (i.e., in the `accept()` method). If it is in the Object, we have direct access to the iterator (e.g., to find the children of a node). 

In general we will need to do some reasoning inside each Visitor implementation to sort out how and what we want to do. 

# CRC cards exercise

Introduce CRC cards. Class-Responsibility-Collaborators. This is from Beck and Cunningham, “A Laboratory for Object Oriented Thinking”, OOPSLA 1989.

1. Class: the name of the class/object which we assign a role. Remember, OO is about communication between objects to get work done.
2. Responsibilities - problems to be solved. Aggregation of methods/messages.
3. Collaborators - objects sending or receiving messages to satisfy responsibilities

Use them with MVC example. We outlined the three cards.
- View - Render the Model & Transform Coordinates - Controller/Model
- Model - Maintain Problem info & Broadcast change notifications - Limited collab
- Controller - Interpret user input & Distribute control - View/Model

* Organize spatially to reflect design (groups and abstractions)
* Start with knowns, and work from there
* When a card is too crowded, move responsibilities to an unnamed card

Exercise: apply CRC cards in designing a system for a library management system. This is separate from the checkout and patron management code.
