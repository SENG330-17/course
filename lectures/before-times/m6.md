In this week we will cover object composition. 

Recall that interfaces and classes use the subtype or "is-a" relationship. Give me an example. 

Now we talk about the composition or `part-of` relationship. E.g., an arm is part of a body. COmposition is important for assembling large wholes out of smaller pieces. 

For example, a Team aggregates Players, from whom it aggregates the ability for keeping track of points. The Team's points are then just a sum of the individual player points. 

# Composite Pattern
**groups of objects behave like single objects**
A good way to think about what we are trying to do here is the distinction between folders and files in the file system. When we do `ls` we really don't differentiate between them, *except* that folders have a containment themselves.

- client code should depend primarily on the component type, not the concrete implementations (a Show or CardSource, instead of a Deck or Movie)
- support an open-ended number of configurations by relying on object composition as opposed to class definition.

We have some sample code illustrating this. We want to run a movie theatre. It has `Show`s. Those shows, though, could be a number of actual things. It could be a simple movie, or a series of movies (a double bill). 

Client - `Program`
Primitive - `Movie, DoubleBill, Null`
Interface - `Show`
Composite - `CompositeShow`

**Name**: Composite
**Intent**: treat groups of objects as a single object
**Participants** & **Structure**:

See Fig 6.1 as well in text and class diagram Fig 6.2

## The Null Object Pattern
When we traverse (say) a file system, i.e., a Composite pattern, some of our objects may be empty, e.g. a folder with no children. We could check to see if the references are null (e.g. a BinaryTree node with no children), but that requires a separate check. A `null object` means we no longer have to think about this aspect, and can do a `no-op` with the null object.

# Decorator Pattern

## Design Problem

You need to implement a point-of-sale system for a coffee shop. The coffee shop has some basic beverages, but customers can customize their drinks by choosing what kind of milk they want, if they want flavoured syrup, etc.

You could create a class for each drink, but there are so many possible combinations that the number of classes would quickly get out of hand. 

Similarly, we could have a single `MultiDrink` class that used some ungodly number of `switch` statements to correctly handle the behavior desired. But that would lead to a God class with multiple responsibilities. 

## Decorator Pattern

**Name**: Decorator
**Intent**: Attach additional *responsibilities* to an object dynamically
**Participants** & **Structure**:

## Decorator Concepts

- Decorators should be of the primitive type. This allows for Decorator chaining
- Be additive, ie., Decorator classes cannot remove e.g. whip cream if you specify another decorator. 
- implement the primitive type, and delegate that method to the decorated object (e.g. draw(), cost(), etc.)
- decorate the same object
- Original object identity will be lost.
- Decorator common in GUI applications - for different styles of popup windows for example.

## Java Library Example

`BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(new File("a.txt")));`

# Sequence Diagrams
I left sequence diagrams to students to read up on. The key thing to focus on is how they capture the flow of control. 

# <!--Using Logging-->
<!--What do we want to log?-->
    <!--- what would you like to see when debugging a crashed application?-->
    <!--- consider the case where you don't get access to the stack trace, e.g. running on a hosted instance-->
    <!--- tradeoff performance for debuggability - log files get very large, very quickly. Examples of servers crashing because log files consumed all disk space.-->
    <!--- log "levels": ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE-->

<!--Why log vs say sout?-->
    <!--- turn logs on or off as needed (e.g. with --warn flag)-->
    <!--- more metadata, object information-->
    <!--- different `Appender`s allow for different destinations-->

#Object copying

- explain with `Show.clone()`

- see also the figures [in this SO question.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/869033/how-do-i-copy-an-object-in-java) 

- Chapter 6.6 of the book

- Keep in mind Bloch's comments in "Effective Java":
 > Override Clone() judiciously 

# # Prototype Pattern

Change the default class at runtime where the type cannot be known ahead of time (i.e. at implementation)

Begin by creating the prototypical class - here, Deck. But support dynamic switches in what that prototype refers to - `setPrototype;` and ways to get that card source. 

Downside: the specific type of Prototype is not guaranteed, and may be switched dynamically. So clients must depend on the interface (which is just good practice anyway). E.g., don't assume Deck specific fields and methods.

# Command Pattern

- commands map to function/method calls typically. Think of a "Command" as something you could invoke from a menu item.
- but perhaps we want to treat a `Command` more holistically
    + for example, to support Undo, to map to GUI elements, to support macros
+ We therefore want to make these function calls - to `draw()` cards, for example - their own objects, so we can do new things with them. 
- solution: interface + implementations 
- The Command interface isolates the specific command from the need to call a generic command
- See Fig 6.16
- The book discusses many possible design choices:
    - How to access the target
    - Data flow
    - Ensuring pre/post conditions are met
    - Encapsulation (deck/draw/undraw)
    - Storing command history

# 'Law' of Demeter

- AKA principle of least knowledge
- Ensure loose coupling so that units of the program (objects) don't require in depth knowledge of other classes. 
- Consider `aFoundations.getPile(FIRST).getCards().add(pCard);` from the book. This rehires the class for the aFoundations object to know about how to add cards.
- Objects should only rely on 
  - implicit parameter
  - The instance variables of its implicit parameter;
  - The arguments passed to the method;
  - Any new object created within the method;
  - (If need be) globally available objects.
- - use only one "dot"
- add more helper methods (at expense of clutter)
