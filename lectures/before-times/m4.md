# State and its importance
- concrete state - the object at runtime
- abstract state - some abstraction of the potential state space, example being "positive account balance". Importance of selecting abstract states to help with concrete implementation. 

# State Diagrams

Exercise: capture the state of a system simple enough to manage cruise control. Here is a [detailed example.](http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/teaching/cs1/CS1/Ah/Notes/CaseStudyCruiseControl.pdf) 

Try modeling a course at UVic.

Key points: states reflect the world/system at a point in time and so are probably nouns. Transitions from state to state are the verbs. This is subtle; we might represent a transition as a state, if it has domain importance (a question of the level of abstraction). Consider checking a PIN in an ATM. If this happens quickly, or is handled elsewhere, we might collapse that into a transition.
Keep in mind the distinction between states of the world/problem being modeled, and state of the system capturing that world. 

# Object identity
- **identity** - typically the memory location on the heap. Use the sample images from the debugger and Object diagram: ![debugger and physical locations diagram](https://github.com/prmr/SoftwareDesign/raw/master/modules/figures/m03-debugger.png) 
- Java use reference objects, so two objects are equal if the references point to the same id. Two Aces are not equal since they must be different memory addresses.
- We still want a way to say two Ace of Clubs are "the same card", thus we need to override the Object base class methods `equals()` and `hashcode()`. **Equality** is *programmer-defined*.
- Default for `Object` is that `.equals(Object)` and identity `==` are the same (comparing ids). But that might not be useful for our design. 
- Walk through the `equals()` code in the module for Card.
- Note that we also need to create a hashcode. Ask the students what a good way to do this is (some combination of Rank + Suit). 
- **Unique**: ask why we would want things unique. The text explains that we should insist our design makes having 2 identical cards impossible (no cheating!). Uniqueness is hard to guarantee but Flyweight and Singleton attempt it.
- Difference is between *immutable* and *unique*. In many cases they will be similar, but we may have a unique Car (say) that can still be changed - for example, have an engine added.

# Controlling object creation

## Flyweight pattern

- we don't always want new objects. For invariant state that is immutable, **value objects** that hold the invariant are much more efficient than hundreds or thousands of objects.
- At some point the Flyweight factory (method/class) has to see if there is already an object with this property (using our equals/identity discussion above). That check is different depending on what the simple state is. 
- Flyweight: **problem**: avoid large numbers of objects being created. **Solution**: Define an immutable Flyweight object to manage invariant state. 
- Other examples: characters in word processing, primitive sprites in graphics, 

## Singleton pattern
- the important thing is to prevent new instances of a given class (as opposed to unique instances). Compare the concept "five of hearts, six of hearts" (unique Cards) to "LimitedResourceController" (a single access point to some resource).
- Manage access to shared global state - e.g. the state of a game of chess or solitaire 
- *a single instance of a class*, as opposed to *unique instances of a class* (flyweight)

# Closures

The notion of anonymous classes/functions (lambdas). They have a strange scope that amounts to copying the current state into a new object. 

- we like anonymous classes because (for small enough model problems) they prevent clutter and add to encapsulation. However, how does it work? 
- Text figure 4.8
- the closure created by copying references still allows for two objects to modify a third (see diagram). This is a good design tradeoff discussion, as we want to allow for the convenience of anonymous classes accessing the parent fields, without cluttering the namespace.
- "This value in the enclosing scope is remembered even when the variable goes out of scope or the function itself is removed from the current namespace." See Fig 4.10
- A **closure** is a method definition together with references to its local environment variables
- The key takeaway here is the difference between two objects which are logically equivalent, and the result of `Object.equals()`, which unmodified is simply comparing memory locations.
