## Review

Format: 1/3 short answer and multiple choice questions testing basic recall.

1/3 code completion and paragraph questions.

1/3 one page code or diagram answers. 

Prepare by studying the text, and doing the exercises. I assume you have done those. I prefer to test knowledge by asking you to show it in Java code. So be prepared to write and read code.
