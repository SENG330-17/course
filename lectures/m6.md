In this week we will cover object composition. 

Recall that interfaces and classes use the subtype or "is-a" relationship. Give me an example. 

Now we talk about the composition or `part-of` relationship. E.g., an arm is part of a body. COmposition is important for assembling large wholes out of smaller pieces. 

For example, a Team aggregates Players, from whom it aggregates the ability for keeping track of points. The Team's points are then just a sum of the individual player points. 

# Composite Pattern
**groups of objects behave like single objects**
A good way to think about what we are trying to do here is the distinction between folders and files in the file system. When we do `ls` we really don't differentiate between them, *except* that folders have a containment themselves.

- client code should depend primarily on the component type, not the concrete implementations (a Show or CardSource, instead of a Deck or Movie)
- support an open-ended number of configurations by relying on object composition as opposed to class definition.

We have some sample code illustrating this. We want to run a movie theatre. It has `Show`s. Those shows, though, could be a number of actual things. It could be a simple movie, or a series of movies (a double bill). 

Here's how we represent that in the class diagram. And here is some code.

Client - `Program`
Primitive - `Movie, DoubleBill, Null`
Interface - `Show`
Composite - `CompositeShow`

See Fig 6.1 as well in text and class diagram Fig 6.2

## The Null Object Pattern
When we traverse (say) a file system, i.e., a Composite pattern, some of our objects may be empty, e.g. a folder with no children. We could check to see if the references are null (e.g. a BinaryTree node with no children), but that requires a separate check. A `null object` means we no longer have to think about this aspect, and can do a `no-op` with the null object.

# Sequence Diagrams
We walked through the sequence diagram in the text, and then did an exercise in creating a sequence diagram for the assignment. We first identifed the relevant use cases we might want to design/document - startup, normal operations, shutdown.

Remember that this only shows one execution, and that as usual unnecessary details should be left out. 

# Using Logging
What do we want to log?
    - what would you like to see when debugging a crashed application?
    - consider the case where you don't get access to the stack trace, e.g. running on a hosted instance
    - tradeoff performance for debuggability - log files get very large, very quickly. Examples of servers crashing because log files consumed all disk space.
    - log "levels": ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE

Why log vs say sout?
    - turn logs on or off as needed (e.g. with --warn flag)
    - more metadata, object information
    - different `Appender`s allow for different destinations

# Decorator Pattern
## Design Problem
You need to implement a point-of-sale system for a coffee shop. The coffee shop has some basic beverages, but customers can customize their drinks by choosing what kind of milk they want, if they want flavoured syrup, etc.

You could create a class for each drink, but there are so many possible combinations that the number of classes would quickly get out of hand. 

## Decorator Pattern
Name: Decorator
Intent: Attach additional *responsibilities* to an object dynamically

## Decorator explained
![](img/hfdp-dec.png)

## Decorator Concepts
- Decorators should be of the primitive type. This allows for Decorator chaining
- implement the primitive type, and delegate that method to the decorated object (e.g. draw(), cost(), etc.)
- decorate the same object

## Java Library Example

`BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(new File("a.txt")));`

# Object copying
- explain with `Show.clone()`
- see the figures [in this SO question.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/869033/how-do-i-copy-an-object-in-java) 

# Command Pattern
- commands map to function/method calls typically
- but perhaps we want to treat a `Command` more holistically
    + for example, to support Undo, to map to GUI elements, to support macros
- solution: interface + implementations 

Write code using the command pattern to implement 

# Law of Demeter
- implicit parameter
- The instance variables of its implicit parameter;
- The arguments passed to the method;
- Any new object created within the method;
- (If need be) globally available objects.
- - use only one "dot"
- add more helper methods (clutter)
