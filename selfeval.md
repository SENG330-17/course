# Self-Evaluation Grid

Chose the statement that best corresponds to your situation.

## Question 1

* **I didn't know where to start, or was unable to make any progress, or I kept getting syntax errors and nothing really worked.**
The course will most likely be too difficult for you. If possible, you should consider taking it later so you can refresh you programming skills in the meantime.

* **I managed to get something working but my solution uses basic data structures (arrays, variables), has a lot of loops and conditions, and I had to squash many bugs along the way.** You're a bit behind but it should be possible to catch up by reviewing the programming-related material of SENG265, including re-doing the practice exercises.

* **I solved the problem using mechanisms and abstractions supported by the Java API (for example, regular expressions, a map data structure), and I mostly felt like I knew what I was doing**. You're at the right level for the course.

* **I solved the problem with a single Java statement.** Your level of Java programming skills is more advanced than required.
