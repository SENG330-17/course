# Exercises
The assignment will require design discussion and coding of the solution among 5 people in the class, randomly chosen. **All due dates are defined on the course schedule**.

## Assessment
There are 2 main components:

**Participation and effort**: how much energy the person puts into the discussion. Do they engage? Demonstrate commitment to the exercises? This is measured by TA assessment and the peer rating form. This is a multiplier of the design mark, ranging from 0 (no effort, did not participate) to 1.05 (did all the work and led the design). Thus, if your *group mark* is 75%, your individual mark can be anywhere from 0% to a max of (1.05*75) = 79%.

**Design Solution**: This is the technical skill of the group. At the end of the exercise each group must hand back the assignment with their design solution, in the form of an Architecture Decision Record.

- marks for depth of insight and novelty (0-5). A 5 is a novel solution that demonstrates breadth of analysis.

- marks for proper use of diagrams and notation. (0-5). 0 for no diagrams when necessary. 5 for the most superlative 

- marks for code correctness and understanding of concepts (0-5)

## ADRs
Using a format called an "architecture decision record" ([overview](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) - [example](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md)), write up your design and discussion. 

## Exercises
This semester we will be working, more or less, with a common design problem. Each module we will enhance that design with the new stuff we learned, and build on the work from the week before. Pragmatically, this means your new group of 5 will have to decide which repo to build on (or throw away, depending on the assignment).

### Problem Context
The problem we will use is a [whale monitoring system](https://wildwhales.org). The problem is that whales are hard to track - they tend to go under water and travel long distances. But the DFO and non-profits are keenly interested in understanding the health of our whales. They have created a whale tracker that will log citizen observations of whales (for example, from fishing boats, whale watchers, ferry travelers, cottage owners). We will create parts of a software application - in Java - that can be used to do this.

### Rules/Guidelines
For each assignment the following rules are applicable:
- you get evaluated as a group based on the quality of the submission. You get evaluated individually based on contribution and effort. 
- external references are fine if you document them as such (e.g., with a footnote). Copying designs from others is not acceptable, except in the limited circumstances of building on someone's design from a previous assignment. If for some reason there exists a complete whale system somewhere, please let me know so we can change the deliverable. You are allowed to use WhildWhales as a reference for important domain concepts. 

### Online group project guidelines
Group work can be challenging at the best of times, and this is not that. My guiding principle is from [Bill and Ted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rph_1DODXDU): "Be Excellent to each other". Let me know immediately if the group is struggling or has personality conflicts, sudden problems, etc.

Before beginning an exercise, do the following:
- introduce yourselves: I suggest an ice-breaker. I like the tried and true of 
	- name
	- year/program of study
	- one fun thing you did this summer
	- favourite course you have taken at UVic
	- least favourite food
- identify your group members preferred communication mechanism (Slack? Email? Facebook?) and meeting times (not everyone is on Pacific time).
- identify how you will work: one person in charge, everyone in charge, deadlines, collaboration mechanisms. If you are not using Github to edit the document, record the document address (e.g. Google Docs) and send it to me. Do not use offline tools unless they are version-capable (I.e. plaintext). 
- Figure out (for exercises 3-10) which previous work you might build on. 
- Capture this info (other than the ice breaker stuff) and send it to Alvi. The TAs will be dropping in to one session for 10-15 mins each time, to answer questions and debug problems you got stuck on.
